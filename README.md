# Cleverse Academy exercises

This repository hosts the exercises for Cleverse Academy participants.

The exercises are divided into the following sections:

1. [Foundation JavaScript exercises](./foundation-js/)

   A basic JavaScript exercises for practicing creative/critical thinking
   with JavaScript.

   The problems focus on basic, language-agnostic programming problem
   solving, so they discourage the use of JavaScript-specific or helper
   methods.

   Participants should try to use basic programming control flows like
   a `for`-loop and `if` checks as much as possible. `Array.forEach`
   method is the only allowed JavaScript's `Array` method in these
   exercises.

2. [JavaScript exercises](./js/)

   A more JavaScript-centric problems. It centers more on the JavaScript
   quirks and charateristics, such as the infamous `Object` and the
   language's OOP features.

   Some problems focus more on the language's quirks - e.g., the
   infutiating number handling of JavaScript.

   Helper methods are allowed in these exercises.

3. [Foundation TypeScript exercises (TODO)](./foundation-ts/)

   A basic TypeScript exercises meant to introduce participants to the
   TypeScript type system.

4. [TypeScript exercises (TODO)](./ts/)

   A more advanced TypeScript exercises.
